   **Firebase REST API**
    * What operations does the Firebase REST API support?
      * Sending standard HTTPS requests you can write data to a Firebase reference with a PUT request and you 
      can issue an HTTP GET request to the same endpoint to read the data you saved.
    
    * Do I need to authenticate with Firebase to read or create data?
      * From what I understand about it so far, your working through and admin interface and once your an admin, 
      it seems you only need to authenticate your users in your app not to simply read or create data.
    
    * What format does Firebase expect data to be in?
      * Json data, an object!
