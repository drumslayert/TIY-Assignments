This is a lot more intense!!! This site is more about collecting information from
the consumer as they click on items they potentially want to buy. So they remove
items from one list and re-stack those items into another list of product they
want to purchase. So we need a lot of functions here and my brain still hurting
from spending several hours on the last one. :) It's after midnight, I will have
to come back to this one with a clear head and energy. But you were giving us a
little exposure in class today to this concept. When you were explaining the
differences between a stack and a que. A consumer would be accessing these
lists or dictionaries and unstacking and making a new list of items that they want
to purchase. Then we need more funtions to calculate the price of all the items
in the new list.
