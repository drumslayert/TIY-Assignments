 * null  - Has only one value and is intentionally empty.  _Example:_ var name = (null);
 * Boolean  - A value of true or false.   _Example:_ var name = (true);

**Basic Operations**
  * Arithmetic - Basic math operations such as multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.
   _Examples:_ 14 * 5  would return 70, 8 + 4 would return 12.
  * Comparison - Comparison operators always return a Boolean. 
  _Example:_ var name = (30); name > (25) would return true. var name = ('tom'); name == ('jerry');
  * assignment - Assigns a value to the variable _Example:_ var class = ('code');
 
**Built in Constants**
 * Undefined - A variable that has not been assigned a value would be Undefined. _Example:_ Trey * 8 = undefined
 * NaN -  Value of NaN is Not-A-Number. _Example:_  x = 30 / ('dave'); Would return a value of NaN
 * Infinity - Any positive number multiplied by Infinity is Infinity, and anything divided by Infinity is 0.
