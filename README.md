**4 Primitive Types**
 1. null  - Has only one value and is intentionally empty.  
   * _Example:_ var name = (null);
 2. Boolean  - only has two values that equal either true or false.   
   * _Example:_ var name = (true);
 3. number  - 3.14159 is a ratio.  Whole numbers are integers.  
   * _Example:_ var name = (1);
 4. string  - Is any text or a 'string' of text within single or double quotes.  
   * _Example:_ var name = ('true');
 
**Basic Operations**
  1. Arithmetic - Basic math operations such as multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.
   * _Examples:_ + ,/ , ,- ,* ,  14 * 5  would return 70, 8 + 4 would return 12.
  2. Comparison - Comparison operators always return a Boolean. 
   * _Example:_ >, <, >=, var name = (30); name > (25) would return true. var name = ('tom'); name == ('jerry');
  3. Assignment - Assigns a value to the variable 
   * _Example:_  var, =,  var class = ('code');
 
**Built in Constants**
 1. Undefined - A variable that has not been assigned a value would be Undefined. 
   * _Example:_ Trey * 8 = undefined
 2. NaN -  Value of NaN is Not-A-Number. 
   * _Example:_  x = 30 / ('dave'); Would return a value of NaN
 3. Infinity - Any positive number multiplied by Infinity is Infinity, and anything divided by Infinity is 0.
   * _Example:_  Infinity * 8 returns Infinity
